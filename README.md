# Translate Game
This is the client side (front end) of the translate game. 

Game to practice English vocabulary
The user can insert and manage his list of words he want to practice. 

This project was written in TypeScript using React-Vite, and Tailwind CSS and plan CSS for the style.

This game has been deployed on Render so the initial "Log in" is a bit slow, please be patient.

To clone and run this project in a DEV mode you need to create an .env file with the following items:
VITE_REACT_APP_SERVER_URL_DEV = "http://localhost:5173"
